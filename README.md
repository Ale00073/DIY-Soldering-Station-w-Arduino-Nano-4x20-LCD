# DIY-SMD-Soldering-Station
A DIY Soldering Station with ATMega2560 and SMD parts

Many thanks to Matthias <https://debugginglab.wordpress.com/2014/10/30/soldering-station/> for
the inspiration.
There were some improvments to UI with insertion of bargraphs for desired and actual temperature, 
indication for memory saved last desired temperature and settings with rotary endoder instead of
pot.
